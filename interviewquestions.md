# üíº TypeScript Interview Questions

This document covers common and important TypeScript interview questions, categorized by difficulty. Each question includes a brief explanation or code example.

---

## üü¢ Beginner Level

### 1. What is TypeScript?
> TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It adds features like static typing, interfaces, enums, and type inference.

---

### 2. What are the basic types in TypeScript?
- `string`, `number`, `boolean`
- `any`, `unknown`, `void`, `never`
- `null`, `undefined`
- `object`, `array`, `tuple`

---

### 3. What is type inference?
> TypeScript automatically infers the type of a variable when possible.

```ts
let count = 5; // inferred as number
4. What is the difference between interface and type?
Feature	interface	type
Extendable	‚úÖ (extends)	‚úÖ (intersection)
Declaration Merging	‚úÖ	‚ùå
Use Cases	Object shapes	Primitives, unions, more

5. What does the any type do?
Disables type checking, effectively telling the compiler to ‚Äútrust you.‚Äù Use sparingly.

üü° Intermediate Level
6. What is a union type?
function format(value: string | number): string {
  return value.toString();
}
A union allows a variable to be one of multiple types.

7. What is the difference between any and unknown?
any: Disables all type checking

unknown: Safer ‚Äî forces type checking before usage

8. What are Generics?
function identity<T>(value: T): T {
  return value;
}
Generics allow you to write reusable, type-safe code.

9. What are type assertions?

let input = document.getElementById('name') as HTMLInputElement;
Tell the compiler what the type is (no runtime effect). Use with caution.

10. What are utility types in TypeScript?
Examples:

Partial<T>

Readonly<T>

Pick<T, K>

Omit<T, K>

Record<K, T>

üî¥ Advanced Level
11. What is a mapped type?

type ReadOnlyUser = {
  readonly [K in keyof User]: User[K];
};
Transform each property of a type using keyof and index access.

12. What is a conditional type?

type IsString<T> = T extends string ? true : false;
Enables branching logic in the type system.

13. What is type narrowing?
TypeScript infers a more specific type based on runtime checks.


function print(value: string | number) {
  if (typeof value === 'string') {
    console.log(value.toUpperCase()); // narrowed to string
  }
}
14. What is the never type?
Used for functions that never return or throw.

function fail(message: string): never {
  throw new Error(message);
}
15. How does declaration merging work?

interface User {
  name: string;
}

interface User {
  age: number;
}
The two interfaces merge into one: { name: string; age: number }.

üß† Real-World Scenarios
16. How would you migrate a JS project to TypeScript?
Rename .js to .ts

Add tsconfig.json

Start by using any and gradually replace it

Add type definitions (@types/...)

Enable strict mode when feasible

17. How do you share types between backend and frontend?
Create a shared types/ folder or npm package

Export interfaces and types from there

Use in both projects via import

18. How do you handle dynamic or JSON data safely?

function isUser(obj: any): obj is User {
  return typeof obj.name === "string";
}
Use type guards to check structure before using it.

üß© Behavioral Questions
19. How do you ensure type safety in a team environment?
Enable strict mode

Use shared tsconfig.json

Use ESLint + Prettier

Review PRs with a focus on type coverage

Avoid using any unless justified

20. What tooling do you use with TypeScript?
tsc for compiling

ts-node for dev/testing

eslint with @typescript-eslint

prettier for formatting

vite or webpack for bundling

jest or vitest for testing

üß™ Tips for Interviews
Explain trade-offs, not just definitions

Walk through real examples or refactors

Know common tsconfig flags (strict, esModuleInterop)

Mention experience with migrating codebases or libraries
